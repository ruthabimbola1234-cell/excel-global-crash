# ✈️ Global Air Crashes 

#### Overview
Commercial aviation is one of the safest modes of transportation globally, despite occasional high-profile air crashes. Millions of flights operate each year with very few accidents. Over the decades, improvements in aircraft design, pilot training, air traffic control, and international safety regulations have significantly reduced accident rates. However, air crashes still occur due to a combination of human, technical, environmental, and systemic factors.
#### Common Causes of Aircrash
.  Human error (pilot, crew, air traffic control, maintenance)
.  Mechanical or technical failures
.  Adverse weather conditions
.  Operational issues (runway excursions, loss of control, mid-air collisions)
.  Systemic challenges (navigation interference, communication gaps)
#### Recommendations
•	Strengthen safety culture and non-punitive reporting systems
•	Improve data collection, analysis, and transparency in investigations
•	Focus on high-risk operational areas (loss of control, runway safety, terrain awareness)
•	Invest in advanced technology (navigation, weather forecasting, automation support)
•	Enhance international cooperation and consistent implementation of safety standards
